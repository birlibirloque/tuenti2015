 Challenge 3 - Favourite primes

As you may have already heard, archeologists working on Samos have made a fascinating discovery. It seems that Pythagoreans had a very intriguing daily ceremony: each of them selected one of the first 25 prime numbers, they multiplied those primes that were chosen and wrote down the result on a rock. They repeated this same routine for almost 100 years! We have scanned the rock and you can find the numbers here.

The archeologists heading this research have put out an international call to analyze these numbers, as they believe that extremely valuable historical information can be extracted from those numbers. Specifically, they want to know which prime numbers were most popular in different time periods. Please help us to make this discovery!
